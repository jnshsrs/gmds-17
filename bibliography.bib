	abstract = {Diabetic foot ulcers pose a great burden on both the patient and the health care system. A multifactorial approach is necessary in diagnosing and treating these patients, with the input of many different specialists. These different view points and approaches were the basis for the International Consensus on the Diabetic Foot, resulting in a worldwide network of professionals involved in the management of diabetic patients with foot problems. Moreover, several consensus texts were produced and the project resulted in many (local) national initiatives. These activities, which are a continuous process and which are embedded in the International Diabetes Federation, are described in the article.},

	abstract = {In this ‘Summary Guidance for Daily Practice’, we describe the basic principles of prevention and management of foot problems in persons with diabetes. This summary is based on the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) Guidance 2015. There are five key elements that underpin prevention of foot problems: (1) identification of the at-risk foot; (2) regular inspection and examination of the at-risk foot; (3) education of patient, family and healthcare providers; (4) routine wearing of appropriate footwear; and (5) treatment of pre-ulcerative signs. Healthcare providers should follow a standardized and consistent strategy for evaluating a foot wound, as this will guide further evaluation and therapy. The following items must be addressed: type, cause, site and depth, and signs of infection. There are seven key elements that underpin ulcer treatment: (1) relief of pressure and protection of the ulcer; (2) restoration of skin perfusion; (3) treatment of infection; (4) metabolic control and treatment of co-morbidity; (5) local wound care; (6) education for patient and relatives; and (7) prevention of recurrence. Finally, successful efforts to prevent and manage foot problems in diabetes depend upon a well-organized team, using a holistic approach in which the ulcer is seen as a sign of multi-organ disease, and integrating the various disciplines involved.},

The lactate dehydrogenase activity of 89 sera from patients suffering myocardial infarction and of 55 sera from patients with hepatocellular damage was assayed under optimal conditions using pyruvate, alpha-oxobutyrate, hydroxypyruvate and glyoxylate as substrates. Activity was also measured with lactate as substrate at different pH values. 2. The ratios of activities under these different assay conditions were calculated for both series of patients. Correct differentiations for single ratios ranged from virtually nil for hydroxypyruvate/alpha-oxobutyrate to is greater than 93 per cent for glyoxylate/hydroxypyruvate and glyoxylate/alpha-oxobutyrate. This was little improved by the use of multiple ratios involving up to seven separate assays. 3. The activity ratio of hydroxypyruvate to pyruvate which is consistently greater than unity was found to be inverted in a case of morphine poisoning.},
